# Large-scale Crowd Collision Simulations with Parallel Quadtree

## Schedule
### April 2- April 9 [Completed]
1. Revised project goals and implementation **(Rose + Elly)**
   * Redefined project statement from crowd control to crowd collision
2. Complete sequential implementation of crowd collision simulation **(Elly)**
3. Create visualization tool to debug unexpected behavior of collisions **(Rose)**
4. Write small input files (grid size of 128x128) to test the validity of the code **(Rose)**
### April 9 - April 15 [Completed]
1. Integrate quadtree-based spatial partitioning **(Rose)**
2. Parallelize algorithm with OpenMP **(Elly)**
3. Finish project milestone report **(Rose + Elly)**
### April 16 - April 19

2. Analyse bottlenecks and explore optimization techniques **(Elly)**
    * Parallelize building of quadtree and collision check algorithm
### April 20 - April 22
1. Analyse bottlenecks and explore optimization techniques **(Rose)**
    * Find ways to reduce the number of collision checks
2. Test code with larger input files (ex. grid size of 4096x4096) **(Elly)**
### April 23 - April 26
